# Screenshot Placeholders

This directory contains placeholders for extension screenshots.

## Required Screenshots:

1. **main-interface.png** - Main popup interface showing the glass morphism design
2. **cookie-list.png** - List of cookies with copy/delete actions
3. **search-filter.png** - Search bar with active filtering
4. **export-import.png** - Export/Import dialog with format options

## How to Generate Screenshots:

1. Load the extension in Chrome (developer mode)
2. Navigate to a website with cookies (e.g., github.com)
3. Open the extension popup
4. Take screenshots using Chrome DevTools or any screenshot tool
5. Save as PNG files with dimensions approximately 800x600px
6. Replace these placeholder files

## Design Guidelines:

- Show the glass morphism effect clearly
- Include some sample cookies in the list
- Demonstrate the search functionality
- Highlight the minimal, modern design
